# Get foreign exchange rates

Applies to:

- Partner API

This topic explains how to get foreign exchange rates for a given month.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner API authentication](api-authentication.md). This scenario only supports application user authentication. Application-only is not yet supported.


## Details

- Currently used with [get price sheet API](get-a-price-sheet.md) to calculate expected charges for Azure plan CSP local currencies.
- Foreign exchange rates hold true for the entire month they are posted.
- More information about Azure plan [pricing](pricing.md) can be found in the [Azure plan pricing documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-price-list).
- Partner pricing and foreign exchange rate APIs are not part of the [Partner Center SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/get-started).
- This method returns results as a file stream. File stream is either a .csv file or a zip compressed version of the .csv. Details about how to request compressed files are included below.

## REST request

### Request syntax

| Method   | Request URI                                                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GET** | https://api.partner.microsoft.com/v1.0/sales/fxrates(Month='{month}')/$value                                  |

### URI required parameters

Use the following path parameters to request the month of foreign exchange rates you want.

| Name                   | Type     | Required | Description                                                     |
|------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Month                      | string   | Yes       | Must be in YYYYMM format. If omitted defaults to current month.       |

### Request headers

- See [Partner REST headers](headers.md) for more information.

In addition to the above headers, files can be retrieved as compressed reducing bandwidth and download times. By default the files are not compressed. To get compressed versions of the files you can include the below header value. Realize that compressed sheets are only available from April 2020 onward, all requests prior to April 2020 are only available as not compressed.

| Header                   | Value Type     | Value | Description                                                     |
|------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Accept-Encoding| string   | deflate| Optional. If omitted file stream is not compressed.       |

### Request example

```http
GET https://api.partner.microsoft.com/v1.0/sales/fxrates(Month='201909')/$value HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer
Accept-Encoding: deflate
Host: api.partner.microsoft.com

```

## REST response

If successful, this method returns foreign exchange rates as a file stream. File stream is either a .csv file or a zip compressed version of the .csv.
